# quanitativeMonkeys
A python script that shows that the difference of the SPX and weighing those same stocks evenly from 1990-2010. Used for a Quantiative Finance class at Stevens Institute 
of Technology.

This code does not account for changes in the stocks in the SPX over the years, for more information see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies).
I am unsure when the list of S&P companies was correct, it might not have actually been from 2010. This also means that these results should be taken with a grain of salt.

## Why
The S&P 500 is made up of around 500 companies that is one of the most widely used indexes for the US stock market. The size of the company (market cap) is what 
decides its weight in the index. This means that larger companies can easily move the index, while smaller companies can't as easily. So what would happen if the 
index was equally weighted?
